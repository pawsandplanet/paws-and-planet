      <p>The issue of animal overpopulation continues to be a challenge in semi-urban and rural India, leading to human-animal conflict, spread of zoonotic diseases, and immense suffering for free-roaming dogs. To address this, Paws and Planet - PNRF (then Plant Neuter Repeat (PNR) Foundation) carried out a Mass Sterilisation Project in Bishnupur, Bankura district, over a span of three months. This initiative was designed to reduce stray dog populations humanely, improve public safety, and create a foundation for long-term coexistence between animals and people.</p>
      <p>Since its inception, Paws and Planett has focused on animal birth control (ABC), vaccination drives, and community outreach. Prior to this project, we had already sterilised and vaccinated more than 4,000 dogs and cats across Kolkata, while also attending to emergency medical cases and supporting underprivileged animal feeders with monthly supplies.</p>
      <p>Despite operating without our own facility, vehicles, or paid staff, we partnered with existing veterinary setups in Kolkata and mobilised a network of volunteers to achieve these results.</p>
      <h3>Why Bishnupur?</h3>
      <p>Bishnupur and nearby areas had seen a steady increase in the stray dog population, which led to:</p>
      <p><ul>
      <li>Frequent instances of dog-human conflict.</li>
      <li>A heightened risk of rabies outbreaks.</li>
      <li>Starvation and neglect among the free-roaming animals.</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>Recognising the urgent need for intervention, the Foundation implemented a structured sterilisation and vaccination drive in Bishnupur with support from local authorities.</p>
      <h3>Project Execution</h3>
      <p>The project was divided into phases, each lasting approximately 12 days. The core team included one surgeon, two paravets cum dog catchers, and one supervisor to oversee daily operations.</p>
      <h4>Phase Breakdown</h4>
      <p><ul>
      <li><span>Day 1–2:</span> Dog catching was conducted to build up the surgery lineup.</li>
      <li><span>Day 3–9:</span> Daily operations included dog catching between 6–9 am and surgeries from 11:30 am onwards. The team achieved an average of 20 surgeries per day.</li>
      <li><span>Day 10–12:</span> Post-surgical monitoring was conducted, during which paravets checked each dog, vaccinated them, and prepared them for release.</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>While the surgeon was present during the operational days, the paravets remained on the ground until the last dog was declared fit for release.</p>
      <img src="assets/news/projects/abc-bishnupur-pickup.jpg"/>
      <h3>Resources and Facilities</h3>
      <p>Each surgery was carried out at a cost of ₹1,650, covering surgeon and paravet fees, sutures, anaesthetics, medicines, and dressing items. For the project, we utilised a functional OT setup equipped with autoclaves, surgical instruments, OT tables, LED lights, and oxygen concentrators.</p>
      <p>Additional arrangements included:<p>
      <p><ul>
      <li>A kitchen unit for preparing fresh meals for the animals.</li>
      <li>Feeding and water bowls to ensure post-surgery care.</li>
      <li>Cleaners who assisted with animal care and cooking.</li>
      <li>Lodging and fooding facilities for the team.</li>
      <li>An ambulance and transport cages for safe movement of dogs during pickup and release.</li>
      </ul></p>
      <img src="assets/news/projects/abc-bishnupur-dog.jpg" />
      <h3>Impact</h3>
      <p>The Bishnupur sterilisation project successfully reduced the free-roaming dog population in the area, preventing hundreds of unwanted litters. Beyond controlling numbers, the project:</p>
      <p><ul>
      <li>Lowered the risk of rabies and other communicable diseases.</li>
      <li>Reduced the frequency of dog-human conflict.</li>
      <li>Improved the overall welfare of dogs by sparing them from repeated pregnancies and associated health risks.</li>
      <li>Demonstrated a sustainable model of humane animal population management for other districts to follow.</li>
      </ul></p>
      <h3>The Takeaway</h3>
      <p>The Mass Sterilisation Project at Bishnupur was a significant step toward building a safer, healthier, and more compassionate community. It combined medical expertise, community support, and volunteer dedication to create lasting change.</p>
      <p>The Foundation remains grateful to local authorities, donors, and well-wishers whose support made this intervention possible. Their contribution not only improved the welfare of animals in Bishnupur but also enhanced public safety and health for the community at large.</p>

    title: "Investigation Reveals Major Health and Environmental Risks at West Bengal Poultry Farms",
    subtitle: "A survey of 16 poultry farms in Bankura and Hooghly reveals shocking violations—from reckless waste disposal to the spread of drug-resistant bacteria—posing an immediate threat to public health.",
    date: "Dec 13, 2024",
    category: "Article",

    body: `
      <p>West Bengal's poultry industry, with over 77 million birds as of 2019, is a major part of the state's economy. However, a recent investigation into 16 commercial poultry farms in the</p>
      <p><span>Bankura and Hooghly districts</span> has uncovered alarming and widespread safety violations that pose a serious threat to public health and the local environment. The findings, detailed in a formal complaint to the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB), paint a disturbing picture of negligence and call for immediate government action.</p>
      <h3>Hazardous Waste and Unsanitary Conditions</h3>
      <p>The investigation, conducted between December 2024 and January 2025, found that almost all surveyed farms were disposing of waste in a reckless and dangerous manner.</p>
      <p>Key findings include:</p>
      <p><ul>
      <li><span>Improper Carcass Disposal:</span> Dead birds were frequently left rotting among live ones, dumped in open fields, or abandoned in unsecured pits for stray dogs and foxes to eat. This practice creates a direct pathway for diseases to spread from animals to humans. In one shocking case, a pit designated for burying carcasses had been converted into a farmer's personal toilet.</li>
      <li><span>Contaminated Litter:</span> Poultry litter (a mix of excreta and bedding) was rarely cleaned, leading to an overpowering stench and swarms of disease-carrying flies and rodents. This filthy litter was often sold as untreated manure for agricultural fields, allowing harmful germs to contaminate soil and water sources.</li>
      <li>Medical Waste Dumping: Medical and hazardous waste, including used medicine vials, were carelessly thrown out near the farms, posing a further environmental risk.</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>The conditions inside the farms were equally appalling. Many units were filled with toxic gases like ammonia from the accumulated waste, creating severe respiratory risks for workers and nearby communities.</p>
      <h3>The "Superbug" Threat from Antibiotic Misuse</h3>
      <p>The report highlights another invisible but critical danger: <span>Antibiotic resistance.</span></p>
      <p>The excessive use of antibiotics in these poultry farms has led to the development of drug-resistant bacteria, or "superbugs". According to a Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) report cited in the complaint,</p>
      <p><span class="italic">100% of certain pathogenic bacteria isolated from poultry litter were found to be resistant to multiple drugs.</span></p>
      <p>When this contaminated litter is used on farms, these superbugs can enter the food chain through soil and water. This poses a severe threat to public health, as it can make human infections much more difficult, or even impossible, to treat.</p>
      <h3>A Call for Urgent Action</h3>
      <p>The complaint letter urges the West Bengal Pollution Control Board to take immediate and decisive steps to address this crisis. The author, Arushi Bhattacharya, has requested the following actions:</p>
      <p><ul>
      <li><span>Immediate Inspections and Closures:</span> Officials should immediately inspect the 16 identified facilities and issue closure notices to those in blatant violation of safety guidelines.</li>
      <li><span>Environmental Fines:<span> The violating units should be forced to pay environmental compensation for the damage they have caused.</li>
      <li><span>Regular Audits:</span> A system of regular, unannounced audits should be established to ensure all poultry farms in the state comply with environmental and waste management rules.</li>
      <li><span>Proper Training:</span> Government officers must be trained to effectively enforce the existing environmental guidelines for poultry farms.</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>The investigation makes it clear that the problems in these poultry farms are not isolated incidents but a systemic failure that endangers public health. Swift action from the authorities is crucial to clean up the industry and protect the people and environment of West Bengal.</p>

    title: "Improving Pig Farming in West Bengal: A Call for Humane and Modern Practices",
    subtitle: "By aligning its outdated training manual with national standards for veterinary care and humane housing, the state can build a safer, more productive, and legally compliant industry for its farmers.",
    date: "Jan 15, 2025",
    category: "Article",
    image: "assets/news/articles/pig-husbandry.jpg",
    body: `
    <p>Pig farming is a vital source of income for many families across West Bengal. To ensure this industry is both profitable and humane, it is crucial that farmers follow the best possible practices. However, the state's current training manual for pig rearing has fallen behind national standards set by the ICAR-National Research Centre on Pig (ICAR-NRCP), creating risks for animal welfare and farm productivity.</p>
    <p>By updating its guidelines to align with modern, scientifically-backed methods, West Bengal can empower its farmers, ensure legal compliance, and foster a more sustainable pig rearing industry.</p>
    <h3>The Essential Role of a Veterinarian</h3>
    <p>One of the most significant gaps in the current state manual is the lack of emphasis on veterinary supervision for key procedures. Simple tasks like giving iron injections to piglets, clipping teeth, or treating diseases are mentioned without stressing the need for a professional<p>
    <p>For more serious procedures like castration, the manual is vague about the need for a vet. National standards and animal welfare laws are very clear on this: castration must be performed by a qualified veterinarian using anaesthesia to prevent pain and suffering. Similarly, all medical treatments should be carried out by or under the direction of a veterinarian to be safe and effective. Ignoring this is not just bad practice—it is considered animal cruelty under Indian law.<p>
    <h3>Better Homes for Healthier Pigs</h3>
    <p>A pig's living conditions directly impact its health and growth. The West Bengal manual suggests housing that includes cages, a practice that is now considered inhumane. The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, explicitly states that animals must be kept in a way that allows them a reasonable opportunity for movement. Cramped cages violate this law.</p>
    <p>The solution is to adopt the ICAR-NRCP’s clear, science-based space requirements, which provide specific floor and yard space for pigs of different sizes and ages. For birthing sows, simple additions like guard rails in pens can prevent piglets from being accidentally crushed, and warm "creep spaces" can drastically improve piglet survival—details currently missing from the state guide.</p>
    <h3>Smarter Farming for Better Results</h3>
    <p>Modern pig farming relies on proven techniques for feeding, disease control, and management.</p>
    <p><ul>
    <li><span>Feeding and Disease Prevention:</span> The state manual encourages feeding leftover food or waste from markets, which can be risky and lead to malnutrition if not properly managed. The national recommendation is to use quality-controlled feed that is clean, dry, and nutritionally balanced. Furthermore, the manual lacks a clear vaccination schedule, a critical tool for preventing disease outbreaks. Including the ICAR-NRCP’s schedule for diseases like Classical Swine Fever and FMD is essential for herd health. Farmers also have a legal duty to report suspected outbreaks of major diseases to local authorities to protect all livestock in the area.</li>
    <li><span>Breeding and Identification:</span> When it comes to artificial insemination (AI), the manual vaguely mentions a "special device". This is insufficient. National guidelines require the use of medically approved, sterile catheters to ensure the process is safe and doesn't cause injury or infection. The manual also fails to mention animal identification. Without guidance, farmers may resort to harmful methods. The recommended practice is humane ear tagging, which is crucial for proper record-keeping and health monitoring.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>A Call for Change</h3>
    <p>Aligning West Bengal's pig rearing manual with the national ICAR-NRCP standards is a necessary and logical step forward. These changes protect animals from unnecessary suffering, ensure farmers are compliant with the law, and ultimately lead to healthier pigs and more stable incomes. It is a win-win situation that promises a brighter, more humane, and more prosperous future for pig farming in the state.</p>

    title:"The Living Jewels of Galiff Street: A Story of Vibrant Trade and Hidden Suffering",
    subtitle:"Inside Kolkata's largest ornamental fish market, a thriving economy clashes with a deep crisis in animal welfare.",
    date:"Feb 10, 2025",
    category:"Article",
    image:"assets/news/articles/ornamental-fishes.jpg",
    body: `
    <p>Every Sunday, a stretch of North Kolkata transforms into a vibrant, chaotic hub of activity. This is the Galiff Street market, the largest wholesale ornamental fish market in Eastern and North-Eastern India and a primary destination for pet lovers from across the region. The market is a testament to West Bengal's dominance in India's ornamental fish trade, a sector where the state contributes approximately 90% of the nation's total export earnings. Here, amidst the bustling crowds and calls of vendors, one can find a dazzling array of "living jewels"—ornamental fish in every imaginable color and shape.</p>
    <p>However, behind this colorful spectacle lies a darker reality of widespread animal suffering and systemic neglect. The conditions at Galiff Street serve as a stark, ground-level illustration of the broader challenges facing aquatic animal welfare in India. In a nation that is the world's third-largest fish producer, aquatic animals are often overlooked, despite being the second largest category of animals killed annually and recognized as sentient beings capable of experiencing pain and distress. The story of Galiff Street is therefore not just about a single market; it is a microcosm of a national challenge, where a thriving trade exists in direct conflict with the welfare of the animals that sustain it.</p>
    <h3>A Vibrant, Unorganized Spectacle</h3>
    <p>The market's scope is immense. From the early hours of 5 a.m. until late afternoon, its temporary stalls cater to a diverse clientele of wholesalers, local retailers, and passionate hobbyists. The offerings extend beyond fish to include colourful birds, puppies, rabbits, and an assortment of ornamental plants and bonsai trees. The trade is supported by a complex ecosystem of functionaries, including about 125 businessmen involved in the ornamental fish trade, accessory dealers selling everything from aquariums to feed, live food sellers harvesting worms from nearby canals, and even child hawkers who earn commissions by persuading buyers.</p>
    <p>The sheer diversity of aquatic life is staggering. A survey conducted between 2007 and 2010 documented 139 varieties of exotic ornamental fish and 60 species of indigenous fish being traded. Goldfish varieties dominate, accounting for about 50% of market sales, followed by popular species like angel fish, molly, and tetra. In recent years, high-value exotic species such as Arowana, Discus, and Flower Horn have also found a prominent place, signaling the market's commercial significance. Yet, this entire enterprise is completely unorganized. The shops are temporary structures, many without a roof, forcing traders and customers to endure harsh weather, particularly during monsoon months. There is no standardization of prices, leading to inconsistent costs and persistent bargaining.</p>
    <img src="assets/news/articles/ornamental-fishes-display.jpg" />
    <h3>A Cascade of Welfare Failures</h3>
    <p>The chaotic and primitive nature of the market directly results in severe compromises to fish welfare. The very methods of display are a primary source of stress and suffering. Most traders exhibit their fish in small plastic bags filled with water, hanging from wooden planks and grills. Others use plastic buckets or small glass aquaria, often stuffing multiple species together without any regard for compatibility or the maximum number of fish an aquarium can sustainably support.</p>
    <p>These practices are in direct opposition to the foundational principles of animal welfare. Scientific understanding confirms that less-stressed fish have stronger immune systems, while poor welfare conditions lead to lower-quality, unhealthy animals. At Galiff Street, the consequences are clear and dire. The fish are subjected to continuous exposure to direct sunlight, and traders perform frequent water exchanges without any attempt to adjust for temperature or other crucial water parameters. This casual disregard for the sensitive nature of ornamental fish leads to "considerable fish mortality," a fact openly observed in the market.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, the lack of basic infrastructure exacerbates the problem. Most shops do not have a power supply, making it impossible to use aeration equipment to provide essential oxygen to the fish crowded in their containers. Even the process of packing fish for transport is done haphazardly, with oxygen often administered without proper measurement, resulting in high mortality rates before the fish even reach their final destination. This cycle of neglect is perpetuated by a lack of knowledge; most traders do not have proper information on rearing and feeding, often misguiding hobbyists who purchase the fish.</p>
    <img src="assets/news/articles/ornamental-fishes-seller.jpg" />
    <h3>The Broader Implications: Economy, Environment, and Law</h3>
    <p>The situation at Galiff Street highlights a crucial point articulated by fish welfare advocates: improving animal welfare is not a niche concern but is directly linked to economic prosperity, environmental sustainability, and legal responsibility. The high mortality rates and poor health of the fish at the market represent a significant financial loss for traders and a poor investment for customers. Research from the Fish Welfare Initiative shows that adopting better welfare practices—such as reducing stress and improving water quality—leads to healthier fish, better growth rates, reduced aggression, and ultimately, more profitable and ethical farming.</p>
    <p>The market's environmental footprint is also a cause for concern. The entire area is unclean, with a garbage dump located right beside the stalls, creating an unpleasant and unhygienic atmosphere. This localized pollution mirrors the broader environmental issues linked to poorly managed aquaculture, such as the release of untreated waste that can harm local ecosystems.</p>
    <p>While India has a framework of laws that could address these issues, their application to aquatic animals remains weak. <span>The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960,</span> is the primary legislation, but stronger provisions are needed to prevent the kind of indiscriminate cruelty seen in the fish trade. In West Bengal, acts like the <span>Inland Fisheries Act, 1984,</span> exist to manage fisheries, but their focus has historically been on conservation and production rather than welfare. The rampant violations at Galiff Street underscore a critical gap in both the enforcement of existing laws and the public awareness of fish sentience.</p>
    <h3>A Path Forward</h3>
    <p>Galiff Street market is at a crossroads. It can continue as a hub of vibrant but cruel trade, or it can evolve into a model of responsible and humane commerce. The solutions, as proposed by researchers, are practical and achievable. The market needs permanent shops with proper displaying facilities and reliable power supply for aeration systems. The Kolkata municipality should take action to clean the area and relocate the garbage dump. Furthermore, the traders themselves could form an organization to standardize prices, share best practices, and collectively address their problems.</p>
    <p>By embracing these changes, the stakeholders of Galiff Street can transform it from a place of hidden suffering into a true showcase for the "living jewels" it trades. Doing so would not only alleviate animal suffering but would also create a more sustainable, profitable, and ethical industry for the thousands of people whose livelihoods depend on it.</p>

    <p>In March 2020, as Kolkata joined the world in a historic lockdown, a new and unnerving silence replaced the familiar symphony of our city. For us at Paws and Planet - PNRF, a youth-led volunteer organization, this quiet was deafening for another reason. As streets emptied and shops shuttered, we knew a crisis was unfolding for the silent residents of our city – the street dogs who depend on the daily generosity of its people.</p>
    <h3>A Lifeline, Severed</h3>
    <p>Our immediate concern was the bustling, non-residential heart of Kolkata: the areas around the High Court, the iconic Red Road, and Eden Gardens. On any normal day, this commercial hub is a source of life for dozens of community dogs who are fed by office workers, street vendors, and compassionate passersby.</p>
    <p>With the lockdown, this lifeline was severed overnight. We pictured them wandering the deserted avenues, confused and hungry, waiting for people who would not be coming. We knew we had to act.</p>
    <img src="assets/news/projects/covid-feeding-dogs.jpg" />
    <h3>Our Promise in Action</h3>
    <p>Driven by our core mission of animal welfare, we launched an emergency feeding drive. Our promise was simple: no dog in this area would go hungry on our watch.</p>
    <p>For over five consecutive months, our dedicated volunteers made this promise a reality.</p>
    <p><ul>
    <li><span>A Daily Mission:</span> Every day, without fail, we prepared and distributed fresh meals, reaching 50 to 60 dogs across this vast area.</li>
    <li><span>Round-the-Clock Care:</span> We established a routine of feeding them thrice a day – morning, afternoon, and evening – to ensure they remained healthy and nourished.</li>
    <li><span>Safety First:</span> The safety of our volunteers and the community was paramount. We worked in small, dedicated teams, strictly adhering to all pandemic protocols, including masks, sanitization, and social distancing.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <img src="assets/news/projects/covid-feeding-cats.jpg" />
    <h3>A Community Answered Our Call</h3>
    <p>We started this project with our core team, but we shared our journey on social media, hoping to raise awareness. The response was overwhelming. The images of our work resonated deeply with people across Kolkata, and soon, a wave of new volunteers reached out, eager to help.</p>
    <p>It was a humbling and powerful reminder that compassion is contagious. Our small initiative grew into a community movement, fueled by the kindness of individuals who believed in our cause. We were, and still are, incredibly proud to be a volunteer-forward organization, driven by the passion of people who want to make a difference.</p>
    <img src="assets/news/projects/covid-feeding-volunteer.jpg" />
    <p>This feeding drive during the 2020 lockdown was a defining chapter in our story. It tested our resolve and strengthened our commitment. It was more than just providing food; it was about upholding our duty of care to the animals who share our city.</p>
    <p>Today, the world has changed, but our work continues. The spirit of that mission lives on in everything we do.<p>
    <p><span>This project was made possible by our volunteers and supporters. If you believe in our cause, learn more about how you can join our mission or support our ongoing projects. Together, we are their only voice.</span><p>

    <p>The COVID-19 lockdown of 2020 presented a dual challenge for us at Paws and Planet. While our feeding drives were addressing the widespread hunger among street animals, another, more urgent crisis was unfolding in the empty lanes and bylanes of Kolkata. Accidents, infections, and critical illnesses didn't pause for the pandemic. But the system designed to help them did.</p>
    <p>As a city retreated indoors, the infrastructure for animal rescue ground to an almost complete halt. We found ourselves as one of the very few teams still actively responding to distress calls on the ground.</p>
    <h3>A City Without Ambulances</h3>
    <p>One of our greatest obstacles was logistical: there were no animal ambulances available. The services we, and countless other rescuers, relied on were simply not operational. For an animal bleeding on the road or a cat suffering from a life-threatening illness, this was a death sentence.</p>
    <p>We were faced with a stark choice: watch helplessly, or become the solution ourselves. For our team, there was no choice at all.</p>
    <p>Without hesitation, our volunteers stepped forward, turning their personal cars into makeshift ambulances. The backseats of their vehicles became safe havens for the wounded and the sick. Navigating through police checkpoints with special permissions, our team members became first responders, transporters, and a source of comfort to animals in excruciating pain. It was a testament to their unwavering courage and deep love for animals.</p>
    <p>Thanks to this incredible effort, we were able to rescue, treat, and care for at least 6-7 dogs and cats every single month throughout the most difficult phases of the lockdown.</p>
    <h3>Our Unsung Heroes: The Vets and Partner Hospitals</p>
    <p>A rescue is only the first step; the real battle for survival is fought in the treatment room. We would have been powerless without the incredible support of our medical partners.</p>
    <p><ul>
    <li><span>Our Dedicated Vets:</span> The veterinary doctors who work with our team are the backbone of our operations. Even during the peak of the pandemic, they answered our calls. Putting our cases on priority, they opened their clinics for us and provided critical care, often at personal risk. Their commitment went beyond professional duty; it was pure compassion in action.</li>
    <li><span>Our Partner Hospitals:</span> We are also eternally grateful to the local animal hospitals and clinics that supported us. In a time of immense uncertainty, they kept their doors open for our rescue cases, providing the essential medical infrastructure needed to save lives.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>This network of vets, volunteers, and hospitals created a safety net for those who had nowhere else to turn. It was a powerful display of community and collaboration in the face of an unprecedented crisis.</p>
    <p>The lockdown may be over, but the need for emergency animal rescue in Kolkata never stops. The spirit of resourcefulness and relentless dedication we discovered during those challenging months continues to be the heartbeat of Paws and Planet today.</p>
    <p><span>Every animal we save is a victory for our entire community. To support our ongoing medical and rescue efforts, please consider donating to our cause. Your contribution helps us keep our promise to never turn away an animal in need.</span></p>

    <p>In May 2020, as Kolkata was already navigating a global pandemic, Cyclone Amphan struck with devastating force.</p>
    <p>The aftermath of Cyclone Amphan was a scene of chaos. Uprooted trees and debris littered the streets, a stark reminder of the super cyclone's power. But as the winds subsided, a quieter, more heartbreaking crisis emerged. The very trees that were home to thousands of our city's birds were gone, and with them, countless nests were destroyed.</p>
    <p>The ground was scattered with the storm's most fragile survivors: fledglings and adult birds, injured, displaced, weak, and dehydrated. They were stranded, helpless, and completely vulnerable.</p>
    <h3>A Chorus of Concerned Voices</h3>
    <p>Our mission began with the ringing of our phones. Calls poured in from compassionate citizens—bird well-wishers from all corners of the city who had found a fallen bird and didn't know where to turn. Their calls were our call to action.</p>
    <p>Our volunteers immediately took to the streets, navigating the wreckage to respond to every single call. We didn't just wait; we actively searched, knowing that for every bird reported, many more were suffering in silence. In the days that followed the storm, our team successfully rescued around 30-40 birds, from tiny baby crows to shaken parakeets.</p>
    <h3>Partnership for Rehabilitation and Release</h3>
    <p>Rescuing a bird is only the first step. Proper rehabilitation requires specialized knowledge and care. We knew we couldn't do it alone. We found incredible partners in the <span>Salt Lake Wildlife Rescue Center</span> and other dedicated <span>local bird welfare organizations.</span></p>
    <p>Our role became that of a crucial first responder and transport unit. Our volunteers carefully secured each rescued bird, providing immediate aid, and then safely delivered them into the expert hands of the rehabilitators. There, they received the medical attention, food, and shelter they needed to heal.</p>
    <p>The final, most rewarding chapter of this mission was seeing these birds recover their strength. After weeks of dedicated care, every single healthy bird was released back into the wild. Watching them take flight once more, free and healed, was a moment of pure joy and a powerful symbol of our city's resilience.</p>
    <p>Cyclone Amphan tested our spirit, but it also revealed the depth of our community's heart. It reminded us that our mission at Paws and Planet extends to every creature, big or small, who calls Kolkata home.</p>

    <p>Fewer births mean fewer lives lost. Animal Birth Control (ABC) is the most humane and effective way to manage stray populations and improve the lives of street animals. 
		  By preventing unwanted litters, we reduce suffering, disease, and conflict in overcrowded areas.</p>
		  <p>Each sterilization is a step toward safer streets—for both animals and people. 
		  Street dogs and cats face harsh conditions: traffic, starvation, abuse, and illness. 
		  ABC protects future generations from this suffering while helping existing animals live longer, healthier lives.</p>
		  <p>It also fosters harmony in communities. When stray populations are stable and healthy, human-animal conflict decreases. 
		  Sterilized animals are often calmer, less territorial, and more accepted by the neighborhoods they live in.</p>
		  <h2>Do Stray Animals Need to Reproduce?</h2>
		  <p>It’s a common question — and an important one. The truth is: stray animals do not need to reproduce. 
		  What they need is safety, food, health, and dignity.</p>
		  <h3>Urban Reality vs. Natural Balance</h3>
		  <p>In the wild, animal populations are controlled by predators, food scarcity, and natural territory boundaries. 
		  But in cities and villages, stray dogs and cats don’t face these natural limits. Instead, they:</p>
		  <ul>
			<li>Reproduce rapidly, often every 6–8 months</li>
			<li>Struggle to find enough food, water, or shelter</li>
			<li>Face disease, abuse, road accidents, and extreme weather</li>
			<li>Often lose most or all of their litter to starvation or illness</li>
		 </ul>
		 <p>So while reproduction is natural, the environment is not. The cycle of suffering continues — generation after generation.</p>
		 <h3>What Sterilization Really Does</h3>
		 <p>Animal Birth Control (ABC) through spaying and neutering isn’t about denying life — it’s about protecting it.</p>
		 <p>By preventing unwanted litters:</p>
		 <ul>
			<li>We reduce the number of animals born into suffering</li>
			<li>The adult animals live longer, healthier, calmer lives</li>
			<li>Fewer puppies or kittens die from preventable causes</li>
			<li>Communities become safer and more harmonious</li>
		 </ul>
		 <p>And importantly: a sterilized animal is often more accepted by the community — less aggression, less roaming, fewer conflicts.</p>
		 <h3>The Humane Choice</h3>
		 <p>No animal benefits from giving birth to litter after litter in dangerous, resource-scarce conditions. 
		 Sterilization gives them a chance at a safer life — and prevents countless others from being born only to suffer.</p>
		 <p><strong>So no, they don’t need to reproduce. They need us to care. And ABC is one of the most powerful, compassionate ways we can do that.</strong></p>
		 <p>We handle the procedures, aftercare, and coordination — all you need to do is support the mission. Together, we’re building a kinder world for street animals.❤️</p>

    title:"Why Fostering Matters",

    <p>Fostering animals has a profound impact—not just on shelters and animals, but also on the people who open their homes to foster. Here’s why it matters:</p>
		  <h2>Benefits for Shelters</h2>
		  <p>Every foster home creates space in a shelter for another animal in need. 
			This can help reduce overcrowding and even lower euthanasia rates in areas where animals are put down after a certain period. 
			By fostering, you're directly helping shelters manage resources better and save more lives.</p>
		  <h2>Benefits for the Foster Animal</h2>
		  <p>Shelters can be stressful for many animals—loud noises, unfamiliar smells, and constant activity can overwhelm them, especially if they’re ill, nursing, elderly, or shy.</p>
		  <p>Foster homes provide a calm and nurturing environment where these animals can heal, grow, and regain trust. Fosterers play a critical role in helping pets recover from trauma, adapt to home life, and become more adoptable. 
		  Training, socialization, and routine care in a home setting prepare them for success in their forever homes.</p>
		  <h2>Benefits for the Fosterer (You!) </h2>
		  <p>Fostering is deeply fulfilling. You’re not just giving a pet temporary shelter—you’re offering them a second chance at life.</p>
		  <h3>Why You Should Consider Fostering:</h3>
		  <ul>
			<li>You Help Relieve Shelter Pressure: By taking in a foster pet, you free up shelter space for others in need.</li>
			<li>You Aid in Adoption Prep: Your foster pet will learn what it’s like to live in a real home—making them more likely to be adopted.</li>
			<li>You Provide a Healing Space: Recovering pets do better in homes than in crowded shelters.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <h3>The Personal Rewards:</h3>
		  <ul>
		  <li>Emotional Benefits: Animals bring comfort, joy, and unconditional love. Fostering can boost your mood and well-being.</li>
		  <li>Builds Compassion and Responsibility: Especially for families, fostering teaches empathy and the value of caring for another life.</li>
		  <li>Positive Community Impact: Your act of kindness raises awareness and inspires others to support stray and rescue efforts.</li>
		  <p>Fostering is one of the most direct ways you can save a life. Every animal you foster opens up space for another to be rescued from the streets or shelters. Whether it's for a few days or a few months, your care helps animals recover, socialize, and prepare for permanent adoption.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Many animals are abandoned due to injury, old age, or temporary family issues. Fostering gives them a second chance without crowding shelters. It also helps us learn more about the animal’s behavior and needs, which makes adoption more successful.
